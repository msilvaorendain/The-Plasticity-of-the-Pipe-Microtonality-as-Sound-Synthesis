  abstract = {In books on acoustics the pitch of organ pipes is treated as being dependent solely on the length of the pipe, while at the same time it is recognised that, as a consequence of the conditions existing at the open end or ends, the length in question is somewhat greater than that of the pipe itself. The “correction for open ends” has been calculated for particular cases, and for the open end of a pipe of circular section amounts to an addition to its length of about 0·82 times the radius. The conditions at the base, or speaking end, are more complex, and for this (as far as I am aware) no similar correction has been worked out. For these reasons the natural pitch of an organ pipe cannot be accurately determined from its material dimensions, but only by experiment; such, for instance, as noting the frequency of an exterior source of sound which produces the maximum resonance in the pipe. When an organ pipe is made to “speak” in the ordinary way, it is a matter of common knowledge that the pitch of note produced is to some extent dependent on the pressure of the wind supply, and the fact (though often mentioned) has not been satisfactorily accounted for (Lord Rayleigh has published an accurate series of experiments on this subject, which will be referred to later.) The true explanation is exceedingly simple, but, like many other problems of the flow of fluids, it cannot, at present at any rate, be treated on a purely dynamical basis.},

The wooden organ pipe was located in the anechoic chamber and activated with a constant air flow, produced by an external air-compressor. Thus, a long-term steady state response was possible to obtain. Multi-channel acoustic vector sensor was used to measure the sound intensity distribution of radiated acoustic energy. Measurements have been carried out on a defined fixed grid of points. A specialized Cartesian robot allowed for a precise positioning of the acoustic probe. The resulted data were processed in order to obtain and visualize the sound intensity distribution around the pipe, taking into account the type of the organ pipe, frequency of the generated sound, the sound pressure level and the direction of acoustic energy propagation. For the open pipe, an additional sound source was identified at the top of the pipe. In this case, the streamlines in front of the pipe are propagated horizontally and in a greater distance than in a case of the stopped pipe, moreover they are directed downwards. For the stopped pipe, the streamlines of the acoustic flow were directed upwards. The results for both pipe types were compared and discussed in the paper.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the experimental examination of an alternative lingual organ pipe construction that uses a free tongue which, in contrast with traditional lingual organ pipes, operates in a blown open manner. A possible advantage of the construction is that it can enable changing the windchest pressure and thus, achieving an extended dynamic range while keeping a constant pitch. Three experimental pipes with diverse resonator shapes are investigated in various setups. The three pipes also demonstrate the variety of timbres obtainable by different configurations of tongues and resonators. The analysis of the measurement results shows that the pipes exhibit a very good stability of the fundamental frequency and can have a dynamic range of 15\,dB. At the same time, the timbre of the sound is found to change significantly as the windchest pressure is increased. Experiments performed with damping the resonator reveal the working principle of the tongue–resonator coupling in the alternative construction. Several sound recordings are presented as multimedia file attachments enabling the subjective comparison of the pipe sounds.},

  abstract = {Today’s organists are trained to be exceptionally versatile musicians. One moment they’re improvising a buoyant cadenza for a Handel concerto, and the next they’re conjuring up images of the beast of the Apocalypse through the music of Messiaen,” says Paul Jacobs, chair of the Juilliard organ department. “Historically, most organ music has been written by skilled organists themselves. Today, the organ, the most complex of musical instruments, might seem daunting to some contemporary composers. But fruitful collaborations between composers and organists, have, fortunately, become commonplace at Juilliard.},

  abstract = {This paper summarises work published and presented previously, supported by additional material. It can be clearly demonstrated by blowing an organ pipe that its transient can be varied, although the effect is not generally considered musical. It has been debated for several decades whether mechanical pipe organ actions allow the player to vary the transient by the way in which the key is moved. Opinions vary from transient control being fundamental to organ playing to it not being possible. This work shows that the physical characteristics of mechanical organ actions work against transient control and this is corroborated by measurements of key and pallet movements and pressure changes whilst organists are playing. It also looks at what other methods organists are using in order to play expressively. The paper also considers how transients might vary due to other characteristics of organs that are outside players direct control but might lead them to believe that variations are due to differences in their key movements.},
