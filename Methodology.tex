\section{Criteria}

- music practice oriented (performing/composing, building)\\
\\
- outcome should be beneficial for others (organists/composers/organ builders) and create bridges between organs\\
\\
- the focus should rely on the artistic use of the broad sound palette of the organ pipe as single instrument and the organ as a whole synthesisers of sound and thus give us new insights into what Klangfarbe can mean in terms of composition \\
\section{Goals of the music practice}

- translate musical ideas using dynamic wind across organs to create real situations/problems concerning performing and composing across different organs and find its possible solutions\\
\\
- experiment through compositions the potential of partial registration for more complex Klangbarbe\\
\\
- 
\section{Music Practice}

- composing around 40min. music using dynamic wind\\
\\
- adapting and documenting the process of the music to at least 4 different organs (writing detailed score for each adaptation)\\
\\
- analyse and reflect on the adaptation: where are the bridges and where are the gaps? How can the gaps be artistically solved?
