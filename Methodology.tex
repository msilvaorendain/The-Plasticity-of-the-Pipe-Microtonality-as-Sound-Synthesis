\chapter*{Methodology}

\section{Artistic Concept}

To treat organ pipes as individual instruments rather than as part of a larger whole, due to their versatility when interacting with dynamic wind, opens up the possibility of delving into Klangfarbe at a deeper level. This mirrors how organists elaborate on timbre through the art of registration but, in this case, this is explored at another dimension. This microscopic exploration of sound involves the use of overtones, multiphonics, noises, microtonality, and other abstract sounds to synthesise complex Klangfarbe. The aim is to develop a new understanding of what Klangfarbe can potentially be and its significance in composition, particularly in relation to microtonal music theory. This exploration extends to the impact on the overall sound design of organ pipes and the architecture of the organ itself, suggesting potential trends for future research and innovation among organ builders.

\section{Criteria}

- music practice oriented (performing/composing, building)\\
\\
- outcome should be beneficial for others (organists/composers/organ builders) and create bridges between organs\\
\\
- the focus should rely on the artistic use of the broad sound palette of the organ pipe as single instrument and the organ as a whole synthesiser of sound and thus give us new insights into what Klangfarbe can mean in terms of composition \\

\section{Goals of Music Practice}

- explore similitudes across diverse organs including organs without dynamic wind systems but with mechanical tracker action to explore partial registration as a dynamic wind alternative technique\\
\\
- translate musical ideas using dynamic wind across organs to create real situations/problems concerning performing and composing across different organs and find its possible solutions\\
\\
- experiment through compositions the potential of partial registration for more complex Klangbarbe\\
\\
- 
\section{Music Practice}

- 2 compositions: 

Suite "Orangerie" 
Originally composed for the Große Orgel in Kassel, first two movements use only partial registration
-adaptation for the organ at Musiikkitalo, for the organ in St. Catherin's Church Frankfurt (no dynamic wind), for the Dynamic Organ in Biel, 

and "Ilmasta Puu", the whole piece needs dynamic wind
Originally composed for the new Organ at the Musiikkitalo in Helsinki
- adaptation to Kassel, Biel. Tolouse (?)

composing around 40min. music for organ with dynamic wind, the music should contain as well \\
\\
- adapting and documenting the process of the music to at least 4 different organs (writing detailed score for each adaptation)\\
\\
- analyse and reflect on the adaptation: where are the bridges and where are the gaps? How can the gaps be artistically solved?

What research in the MA can help me base the proposal for a PhD? What data/information can help me build my Exposé? --- What do I want to propose for PhD? Where? What is the final goal and fiel of research? 

1. Problem/Research Question

How can we create bridges across different dynamic wind organs for composers and organists?

 How can we create bridges across different dynamic wind organs for composers and organists, and how does the exploration of the vast sound-palette of the organ pipe with dynamic wind reveals a new understanding of 

How can composers and organists present their musical works across different dynamic wind organs in Europe? 

2. Artistic Practice (to solve/answer question) 

3. Target groups

Organists, composers (organ builders (?)

4. Procedure of the practice (methodology(?))

Composing and translation of pieces using dynamic wind. 

5. Gathering/Documenting of the practice

6. Analysis of the results

7. Conclusion and reflections

8. Dissemination
