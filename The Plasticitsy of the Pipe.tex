\title{The Plasticity of the Pipe \\
  \large Microtonality as Sound Synthesis \\

\begin{abstract}
Single organ pipes are typically considered part of a \textit{whole} by composers and organists. They themselves are conspicuously immobile and unyielding, and once they leave the organ builder's workshop, their material properties, as well as their timbre and pitch, are fixed. However, dynamic wind opens up a wide sound spectrum even in a single pipe, making it a versatile instrument. This artistic and scientific research project uses the term "plasticity," derived from the Greek "plastikos" (moldable, modifiable), as a metaphor and explores the manipulation of the sound of individual organ pipes through modern and flexible wind supplies. The resulting rich palette of overtones, multiphonics, glissandi, noises, and other abstract sounds in individual organ pipes allows for a profound microscopic manipulation of Klangfarbe and a new understanding of what timbre can be. Registration and the resulting microtonality can be considered a form of additive sound synthesis. The question of how this concept affects the architecture and aesthetics of the organ as a complete synthesiser and the pipe as the sole instrument in the field of organ building brings an interesting perspective. My investigation includes organs such as the Experimentalorgel inaugurated in Kassel in 2021. This instrument, alongside many other new organs and researches on the topic serve as evidence that the exploration of organ building is not yet complete and that there is still much to explore and innovate. To achieve congruent and interesting results, such exploration requires artistic-scientific work and practice. As a consequence, the adaptation process of compositions to various organs in Europe is considered an important epistemic object of this research. This allows for a better understanding of what is transferable and what is only possible on specific organs. It is investigated how these adaptations are implemented and what aesthetic and design decisions can be influenced by them. This understanding aims to build a bridge between organs for composers and organists in the field of new organ music.

NOTES:

What research in the MA can help me base the proposal for a PhD? What data/information can help me build my PhD Expos√©? --- What do I want to propose for PhD? Where? What is the final goal and fiel of research? 

1. Problem/Research Question

How can we create bridges across different organs for composers and organists using dynamic wind?

 How can we create bridges across different dynamic wind organs for composers and organists, and how does the exploration of the vast sound-palette of the organ pipe with dynamic wind reveals a new understanding of what Klangfarbe can mean for composition?

How can composers and organists present their musical works across different dynamic wind organs in Europe? 

2. Artistic Practice (to solve/answer question) 

3. Target groups

Organists, composers (organ builders) (?)

4. Procedure of the practice (methodology(?))

Composing and translation of pieces using dynamic wind. 

5. Gathering/Documenting of the practice

6. Analysis of the results

7. Conclusion and reflections

8. Dissemination
